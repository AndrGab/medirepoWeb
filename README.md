## About MediRepo

In the context of COVID-19, many hospitals have had to restrict visitors, leaving patients' families anxious for information about their loved ones. MediRepo is an innovative solution designed to bridge this communication gap by allowing hospitals to share daily medical reports with patients' families.

## How to Use MediRepo

### For Hospitals

1. **Create an Account:** Get started by creating an account.
2. **Add Medical Reports:** Upload medical reports for patients.
3. **Share Patient Code:** Share the Patient Code and Attendance Code (which acts as a password) with the patient's family.

By using the same Patient Code and Attendance Code, only the latest medical report will be accessible. You can also utilize the Medirepo API to streamline the process of sending medical reports to the application and integrate it with your primary hospital application.

### For Patients' Families

1. **Log In:** Access the application using the provided Patient Code and Attendance Code (password).
2. **Enter Patient's Birthday:** Provide the patient's birthday for verification.
3. **Discover Information:** :tada: Access and view medical information about your :heart: loved one.
