## MediRepo

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/medirepoWeb/community](https://badges.gitter.im/medirepoWeb/community.svg)](https://gitter.im/medirepoWeb/community?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Most hospitals are restricting visitors for COVID-19 Patients.
This is a project to help hospitals to share Daily Medical Reports with those patients' families.

## Live Demo

## How to use MediRepo

### Hospitals

1. Create an account
2. Add a medical report to a patient
3. Share the Patient Code and Attendance Code (this is the password) to the patient's family

Using the same patient Code and attendance Code, only the last medical report will be shared.

With Medirepo API you can send medical reports to the application easier, set up your main application to communicate with our REST API.

### Patient's Family

1. Log in with code and password received
2. Enter the patient birthday
3. :tada: See the information about your loved one :heart:

## Medirepo (REST API)

🎃 HacktoberFest is digitalocean’s annual event that encourages people to contribute to open source throughout October. Much of modern tech infrastructure—including some of digitalocean’s own products—relies on open-source projects built and maintained by passionate people who often don’t have the staff or budgets to do much more than keeping the project alive. 🎃 HacktoberFest is all about giving back to those projects, sharpening skills, and celebrating all things open source, especially the people that make open source so special.
