## About MediRepo

During the COVID-19 pandemic, hospital visitation restrictions left many families anxious for updates about their loved ones. **MediRepo** bridges this communication gap by enabling hospitals to securely share daily medical reports with patients' families.

## How to Use MediRepo

### 🏥 For Hospitals

1. **Create an Account:** Sign up to start sharing medical reports.
2. **Add Medical Reports:** Upload daily reports for patients.
3. **Share Patient Access:** Provide the Patient Code and Attendance Code (password) to the family.

Using these codes, families can securely access the latest medical report. For seamless integration, use the **MediRepo API** to automate report submission or manually upload reports through the web interface.

### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 For Patients' Families

1. **Log In:** Enter the Patient Code and Attendance Code provided by the hospital.
2. **Verify with Patient's Birthday:** Add a layer of security by confirming the patient's date of birth.
3. **Access Reports:** 🎉 View the latest medical updates for your loved one.
